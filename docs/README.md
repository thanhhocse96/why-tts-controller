# Documentation Index

Docs are split into two layers:

```text
docs/design/
  01_...  # design source documents and architecture decisions

docs/milestones/
  M0_001_...  # implemented work, named after .context/MILESTONES.md

docs/artifacts/
  typography-options.html  # exploratory previews and decision artifacts
  vbee-worker-routing-workflow.md
```

## Naming Rules

Design docs use numeric order:

```text
01_<name>.md
02_<name>.md
```

Milestone docs use:

```text
<milestone>_<sequence>_<name>.md
```

Example:

```text
M0_001_gateway-core-fake-end-to-end.md
```

The milestone code must match `.context/MILESTONES.md`.

## Agent Rules

When an agent completes a meaningful implementation slice, it must create or update a milestone doc.

Milestone docs must start with workflow first, then explain:

```text
what was implemented
files changed or added
design patterns used
verification commands or acceptance checks
known limits
```

After adding, moving, or renaming a docs file, update this index.
